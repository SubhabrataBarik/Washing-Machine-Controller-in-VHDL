# Washing-Machine-Controller-in-VHDL
Designed a fully automated washing machine controller using VHDL, FSM architecture
The system effectively manages key operations such as soaking, washing, rinsing, spinning, and drying,
ensuring precise control and sequencing.
Leveraging a 512 MHz clock signal, the controller regulates timing across multiple cycles, with a focus
on optimizing process duration and energy efficiency.
The dual-state FSM model allows for concurrent execution of two rinse cycles, enhancing overall func-
tionality. The project involved creating custom time-controlled transitions for each state and dynamically
adjusting operations based on inputs like lid position and coin insertion.
